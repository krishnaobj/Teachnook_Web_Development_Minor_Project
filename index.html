              <h3>Humayun's Tomb</h3>
              <p>As the name suggests, Humayun's tomb is the final resting place of the Mughal Emperor Humayun. Located in the Nizamuddin East area of Delhi, it is the first garden-tomb in the Indian subcontinent. This splendid piece of architecture was commissioned for construction by Humayun's chief consort Empress Bega Begum in the year 1569-70 and is one of the very few structures that used red sandstone on such a massive scale at that time.</p>
